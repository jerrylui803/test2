# Unit testing in Python

In CSCB07, you have been introduced to unit testing in Java. To refresh your memory about unit testing and yet apply it to a different programming language, this tutorial introduces you to unit testing in Python. 

With the help of the [PyUnit documentation](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/unittest.html) and the embedded Docstring from the class `Queue`, complete the file `queuetests.py` which contains a collection of unittest methods for the class `Queue`.

The challenge for you is to write these tests without a complete implementation of `queue` as if you were defining your validation strategy beforehand or developing your tests in parallel.
