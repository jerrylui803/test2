# Individual Assignment 3

In this assignment, first you need to examine the documentation of a Python class `BoundedQueue` and your goal is to write a unit test suite for this class.

1. Create a file `testboundedqueue.py`
2. Import `boundedqueue`: this module will be provided when I test your test suite.
3. Define a single class `TestBoundedQueue` which will contain a collection of unittest methods for the class `BoundedQueue`.
4. Add an `if __name__ == ’__main__’` block, so that when I execute the command `python3 testboundedqueue.py` it runs your tester on a module `boundedqueue` which contains the class `BoundedQueue`.
5. Finally, push the file `testboundedqueue.py` to your individual repository.

I will feed buggy (but reasonable) implementations of `BoundedQueue` to your tester. Your mark will depend on the number of bugs your tester finds.
